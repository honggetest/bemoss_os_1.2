        This agent listens for outdoor temperature readings then changes
        the cool fan speed.  It demonstrates pub/sub interaction with
        the RTU Controller.

        Requirements for running this agent (or any agent wishing to
        interact with the RTU:

          * Edit the driver.ini file to reflect the sMAP key, UUID, and
            other settings for your installation.
          * Activate the project Python from the project dir: .
            bin/activate.
          * Launch the sMAP driver by starting (from the project
            directory): twistd -n smap your_driver.ini.
          * Launch the ActuatorAgent just as you would launch any other
            agent.

        With these requirements met:

          * Subscribe to the outside air temperature topic.
          * If the new reading is higher than the old reading then
            * Request the actuator lock for the rtu
          * If it receives a lock request success it randomly sets the
            cool supply fan to a new reading.
          * If it does not get the lock, it will try again the next time
            the temperature rises.
          * If the set result is a success, it releases the lock.
